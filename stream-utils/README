Step 1:

Mount the ramdisk. This can be acomplished by executing:

	$sudo ./mountRamdisk

You will get a message either confirming, or claiming you already did this.

Step 2:

execute ./startstream to begin streaming the video. If you get an error, try restarting the gumstix.

An example matlab grabber is in the MATLAB_Files folder. Its set to grab an image out of the ramdisk dir.
